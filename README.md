## Welcome!

I am an undergraduate and student researcher at Columbia University in New York, studying environmental biology.

I am fascinated by the intersection of environmental science and the biological sciences, with research interests in ecology, evolution, and genetics. 

I enjoy traveling, photography and spending time outdoors during my free time and can be reached via email at [sma2244@columbia.edu](sma2244@columbia.edu).
