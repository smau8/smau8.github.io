## Welcome!

I am an undergraduate and student researcher studying environmental biology at the [Eaton Lab](https://eaton-lab.org/) in Columbia University.  

I am fascinated by the intersection of environmental science and the biological sciences, with research interests in ecology, evolution, and genetics. 

I enjoy traveling/spending time outdoors, photography, and music during my free time.
