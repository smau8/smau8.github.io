## Welcome!

I am an undergraduate and student researcher at Columbia University in New York, studying environmental biology.

I am fascinated by the intersection of environmental science and the biological sciences, with research interests in ecology, evolution, and genetics. 

I enjoy traveling/spending time outdoors, photography, and music during my free time.
